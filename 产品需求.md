## MVP Screens üì±

The MVP should focus on the core user journey: **Input ‚Üí Generation ‚Üí Review**. These screens represent the minimum set required to deliver that value.

### 1. Onboarding & Home
* **Sign Up / Log In Screen:** A clean and simple screen for user authentication. Offer email/password and social sign-in options (e.g., Google, Apple).
* **Dashboard Screen:** This is the user's home base.
    * **"Today's Review" Section:** Prominently displays quizzes and flashcard decks scheduled for today via the built-in spaced repetition system. This immediately highlights the app's key review feature.
    * **"Recent Notes" Section:** A list of the last few notes or projects the user worked on for quick access.
    * **Primary Call-to-Action (CTA):** A floating action button or a large, obvious button to initiate the creation process (e.g., "+ Create New").

### 2. Content Creation & Generation
* **New Item Selection Screen:** A modal or full screen that appears after tapping "+ Create New". It presents the core input options:
    * `Create from PDF`
    * `Create from Audio` (Record or Upload)
    * `Start with a blank note`
* **Editor Screen:** This is the central workspace.
    * **Content Area:** A rich text editor where the user can type, paste text, or view the transcribed text from an audio file or the imported text from a PDF.
    * **"Generate" Toolbar:** A key UI element. This toolbar or menu will have buttons like:
        * **`Generate Mind Map`** üß†
        * **`Generate Quiz`**‚ùì
        * **`Generate Flashcards`** üìá
* **Processing/Loading Indicator:** A non-interactive screen or overlay that shows a loading animation and text like "Brewing your quiz..." while the AI is generating content.

### 3. Content Viewing & Studying
* **Project Hub Screen:** A screen that contains all materials generated from a single source. For example, from one PDF, you'd find the original notes, the mind map, the quiz, and the flashcards all linked here.
* **Mind Map Viewer:** An interactive canvas where users can pan and zoom the generated mind map. For MVP, viewing is sufficient; editing can be a future feature.
* **Quiz Interface:** A focused, one-question-per-screen layout.
    * Displays the question and multiple-choice answers.
    * Provides immediate feedback (correct/incorrect) upon answering.
    * A summary screen at the end showing the score.
* **Flashcard Interface:** A classic flashcard view.
    * Shows the "front" of the card (term/question).
    * Users can tap to "flip" it and see the "back" (definition/answer).
    * Includes self-assessment buttons like **`Hard`, `Good`, `Easy`**, which will feed data into the calendar for scheduling the next review.

### 4. Review & Organization
* **Review Calendar Screen:** Not a generic calendar, but a dedicated screen focused on review scheduling.
    * It should present a list or a simple calendar view highlighting days with scheduled reviews.
    * Tapping a day shows the specific flashcard decks and quizzes to be reviewed.
* **Library/All Notes Screen:** A simple list or grid view of all the user's projects/notes. It should include basic search functionality to find past material easily.

## Overall Design Guidelines üé®

Your theme is **Dark Mode + Mango**, which suggests a vibrant, energetic, yet focused aesthetic.

### Color Palette
* **Primary Background:** Use a deep, dark gray, not pure black. This is easier on the eyes. (e.g., `#121212` or `#1A1A1A`).
* **Secondary Background:** A slightly lighter gray for cards, modals, and layered elements to create a sense of depth (e.g., `#2C2C2C`).
* **Primary Accent (Mango):** This is your brand color. Use it for all interactive elements: **buttons, links, selected states, icons, and progress bars**. A vibrant mango color works well (e.g., `#FFC300` or `#FFA500`).
* **Text:**
    * **Primary Text:** Use a high-contrast off-white (e.g., `#FFFFFF` with 87% opacity) for body text and headlines.
    * **Secondary Text:** A lighter gray (e.g., `#FFFFFF` with 60% opacity) for metadata, captions, or less important information.
* **Feedback Colors:** Use standard conventions. A desaturated green for success (`#2E7D32`) and a soft red for errors (`#C62828`) that work well against the dark background.



### Typography
* **Font:** Choose a clean, modern, and highly legible sans-serif font. **Inter, Poppins, or Nunito Sans** are excellent choices that work well in digital interfaces.
* **Hierarchy:** Establish a clear and consistent typographic scale. Use different font weights (e.g., Bold for titles, Regular for body) and sizes to guide the user's attention and make the interface easy to scan.

### UI Elements & Principles
* **Simplicity:** The dark mode aesthetic thrives on minimalism. Avoid unnecessary decoration. Use negative space generously to let the content breathe and reduce cognitive load.
* **Consistency:** All buttons, icons, and interactive elements should have a consistent style and behavior throughout the app. For example, all primary CTAs should be solid mango-colored buttons.
* **Iconography:** Use a single, clean icon set (e.g., line icons or solid icons, but don't mix). Feather Icons or Material Symbols are great resources. The mango accent color should be used for active or important icons.
* **Focus & Contrast:** Use the mango color strategically to draw the user's eye to the most important actions (like "Generate Flashcards" or "Start Quiz"). The high contrast between the vibrant mango and the dark background will naturally create focus.
* **Visual Feedback:** Use subtle animations for hover states, button presses, and screen transitions. A button might subtly brighten or scale up when tapped. This makes the UI feel alive and responsive.
